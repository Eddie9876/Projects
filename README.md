# Depop Calculator

## How it works
- Input y(for yes) or n(for no) if the items you sold were a bundle
  - If the user inputted y then it is gonna go through the bundle process
      1. Through the bundle process, you will enter how many items you have sold
      2. You will then input how much you sold EACH item for, based on the amount of items that you inputted(so 3 for example then it would be asking how much you sold each item 3 times)
      3. It will then ask you how much did you buy it for, like at the thrift store, or even at a normal retail store where they sell clothes
          - This will help up determine the revenue at the end
      4. In Depop there is always a fee for any item you sell, so it will ask you how much was the fee that they put for you to sell the bundle
      5. Some people pay for shipping, some people don't but in this case we are gonna pay for shipping, you will then put the price how much you are paying for shipping
      6. Finally you will then get the revenue that you got from the items that you sold on Depop minus all of the things that you paid for
  - If the user inputted n then it is gonna go through the single item process
      1. Through the single item process, it is similar as the bundle process but it is only gonna calculate the revenue for one single item
      2. It will ask you how much did the item costed
      3. Then how much you paid for the fee
      4. How much then item was when you bought it
      5. Finally it will give you the profit/revenue you made on the item
